# The Business Story
w/ Prof. Dennis Yi Tenen  
MW 1:00pm-4:10pm  
511 Hamilton Hall  

## Course Description

A story in the "occupational" genre develops within a professional setting, like a hospital,
airport, or police department. Occupational novels (and film and television scripts) are widely
consumed but rarely studied. In this course, we will take a deep dive into the history of the
genre, beginning with works from French and Soviet realisms, and continuing to American police
procedurals and Japanese business novels.

Despite its popular image, works in this genre will lead us to profound philosophical questions
about collective intelligence, personal belonging, the emergence of institutional agency, and
the feeling of personal powerlessness in the face of large bureaucracies. Readings from Plato,
Hobbes, Marx, Mary Douglas, Sara Ahmed other institutional theorists will therefore anchor our
weekly discussion.

## Course Structure

3 hour sessions, 2 times a week, for 6 weeks.

Depending on the week, our time in class (and out) will be divided between three types of
activities:

- First, with the emphasis on discussion of primary materials. Occasional "philological walks"
  (discussion while walking in groups outside) weather permitting.
- Second, with emphasis on discussion of secondary materials including literary theory,
  philosophy, and social thought.
- Third, with emphasis on "experimental methods," involving formal analysis, parsing,
  annotating, mapping, diagramming, or site visits.

All texts will be provided via *.pdf* or purchased and must be present in paper format for
active comprehension.

## University Policies

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors, and to
the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the
risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or
ask me for help early in the writing process.
